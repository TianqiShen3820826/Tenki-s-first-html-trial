                <h1 style="text-align: center;">Reason why I choose Information Technology </h1>
                The reason why I chose IT courses in RMIT is that my father said it is easy to get a job after university graduation, because according to some statistics, <br>it shows that RMIT is famously known in the area of high student-employment rate  for graduates, especially in the field of Information Technology. Which is ultimately the reason for me to come to this school to have a study of such things.

                <h1 style="text-align: center;"> My interest in Information Technology</h1>
                Actually, when I was playing numerous games such as Monster Hunter World and it is about 2019, I had known something about Cheat Engine, which is an extremely good software for gamers to use. However, what I mean is not that I like cheating. But I love the way these tools work as I merely think that it is unbelievable to achieve, maybe this is the thing that sparked my fire of interest into the field of Information Technology.I just want to learn some basic skills that could be enough for me to create some nice work about websites. <br> that, Information Technology is likely to be the trend of the future. So it might be beneficial to my ideal occupation.

                <h1 style="text-align: center;">Ideal job </h1>
                    Considering the job I want in the future, I do not want to become professional programmers of Information Technology. The job I want to choose is just normal and stable that could feed up on my own. I would put Ltd into my consideration because as I said, it is stable and it could provide sufficient salary for me. For the requirements of occupation, perhaps it would be low, the graduation of bachelor. <br>But I think after graduating from RMIT, some satisfactions would be met. As I mentioned, just keep going with my assignment in RMIT and do well in them,that is enough for me.

                <h1 style="text-align: center;">Project Plan</h1>
                <br>
                Overview: The project I want to program is named ‘budgetlation’. Budgetlation is a budget-calculation software for the public to use. This application will collect information about various shops around the users’ location, information including prices and reviews will be displayed to the user. The application also records down detailed information of each user's wage, needs and wants. Through analysing these information, the application can then suggest the most suited decision or plan for the user to both satisfy their desire and to create a saving pattern for luxuries that people are likely to enjoy but find it hard to afford. What is more, some applications which have the purpose of promotion could have win-win cooperation with this project.
                Motivation: Many Australians' contemporary issue is the management of their money as they do not know how to resist temptations, that is why ‘Budgetlation’ is borned. People who use budgetlation could easily find out more efficient ways to store or spend their money. Besides that, due to this project’s utility, a great number of users would be attracted, therefore, advertisement or promotion could be attached into budgetlation. In addition to that, with a few simple taps on the mobile phone, users are able to access all the information they would ever need in order to manage their finance.
                Description: First function goal is to well manage the personal savings, it is just like a portable bank that you could see what you are spending on through this application. You merely need to log in the bank account once you register at the very beginning of opening budgetlation, and never have to worry about it again.<br>
                Second function goal is to make proper plans for users, for instance, imagine the circumstance that you only have about 1000AUD per month, this application would offer several plans such as everyday’s spending out on groceries, costumes and so on. Mainly in accordance with the various shops around users’ location. So the second function is more like an experienced delivery man or a secretary who could search all the information to pick out the best thing for the users and even make plans both quantitatively and qualitatively. Furthermore, it could also remind you of something that is currently unaffordable to spend in each month, for example, if you take the most costly plans, this program can provide alternative ways to give the similar experience but at a much lower cost rate.<br>
                The third functional goal is to generate smart plans on every aspect of a user’s financial situation. That is to achieve entertainment while efficiently managing the possession. For example, an average teenage boy who wants to hangout with his friends during weekends but also is saving for a new laptop, Budgetlation will perfectly balance the cash in and out throughout his daily life, and precisely calculate how much he has to spare for the weekly hangout activity. In 2020, it is estimated that 3.2 million people or 13.6% of Australian population is in poverty. Mainly caused by inappropriate spending habits and a lack of motivation to work. With Budgetlation’s help, this number can be reduced, simultaneously creating a more positive working environment by satisfying people’s needs with pinpoint precision management which encourages and lightens the lack of motivation among the lower working class.<br>
                The fourth function goal and the most important function is the online-shopping function. Users can shop through Budgetlation as a convenient and effective way to acquire their daily needs, Budgetlation provides the most suited choices for the user according to their savings and wages therefore users would prefer to use Budgetlation over other shopping applications, and through buying via Budgetlation, Budgetlation can further analyse informations of daily spending, spending limit and etc informations to form the most detailed budget table. Through online shopping, Budgetlation also can take percentage of the item value as interest fee, but this will not come from the users but the owners. A combination of these two makes a win-win combination as users get convenient experience along with worthwhile items and owners of shops get free promotion due to their quality of products, and ultimately, us, who withdraw interest fees, are the main income.<br>
                <h1 style="text-align: center;">Tools and technologies</h1>
                <br>
                To start out, patience. But actually I am not a patient person that could create such a good application, so I just try to be that one. Besides that, as a newcomer to IT, I did not know every software or hardware very well so I could not choose everything exactly I needed. However, I think all these programming languages such as Java,html,css and python could be applied into Budgetlation. But I do think that it is not enough to complete such a masterword just use these basic tools. There is still a long way for me to study if I want to create such a good application like Budgetlation.
                <h1 style="text-align: center;">Skills Required</h1>
                <br>
                There is no special hardware or further softwares for Budgetlation to perform. However, certain skills are required including design, user-friendly and patience. Firstly, good design attracts users and makes the app more appealing. Secondly, user-friendly skills which enables the app to be easy-to-use, understand and control which enables more users to stay on the app. Lastly, patience, as programming for an amature programmer like me is usually filled with error, therefore, I must be patient to re-check the codes constantly and make the app the way I wanted to. These are the three skills I believed will come in place in most of the program designing therefore mastering them is also essential for me.
                <h1 style="text-align: center;">Outcome</h1>
                <br>
                I believe if Budgetlation succeeded, three positive impacts and outcomes will occur. Firstly,it could help people who could not have the ability to well manage their possession, for example, giving lots of useful advice on how to make life better using limited money. Secondly, Budgetlation could bring about tremendous fortune to society such as pushing up the competence between companies and the biggest winner would be consumers, because they could conveniently taste the result of competence,an amazing balance from price to quality. Thirdly, extracting an interest fee from the process of trade could provide a huge monetary benefit.
